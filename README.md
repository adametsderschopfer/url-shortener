# URL Shortener
## Idea
Write a full-fledged complete service with the functionality of a so-called “link shortener”

**And**
- Write auth service on GO based on JWT
- Use GRPc
- Write a protobuf contract, deal with code generation
- Learn to work with errors and logs
- Set up migrations for the database
- Set up automatic deployment via GitHub Actions, write a workflow for this
